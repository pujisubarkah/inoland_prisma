// File recreated to resolve missing import error. Please refactor logic as needed.
// The original import for surveyIndicator has been removed since the file no longer exists.

// ...existing code...
// Remove any usage of surveyIndicator below and refactor as needed.



// Example placeholder export (replace with actual logic):
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const responseId = event.context.params?.responseId;
  // Lakukan logika sesuai kebutuhan
  return { message: 'surveyIndicator removed, refactor needed.', responseId };
});
